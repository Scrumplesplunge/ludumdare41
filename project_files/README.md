# Project Files

These files are source files used to generate some of the assets for the game.

  * `mmpz` files are LMMS project files.
  * `aup` files are Audacity project files.

There are not project files for all assets in the game. Image files serve as
their own project files for a game as simple as this, so they do not have
associated project files. Additionally, some audio assets are just minor
variations on other assets. Project files for those are not included.
